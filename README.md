# Compiling from source

to compile this youll need 

-Devkitpro(obvisouly)

-GRRLIB

- If theres something else not here that I forgot please add an issue on this page and ill be sure to fix it

to compile just type in "make" into your terminal youll most likely get tons of warnings(Which is ok and is whats suppose to happen) which is because of my bad programming.
Once it compiles succefully congraulations you did it!! :)
